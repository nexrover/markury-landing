# Markury — Feature Guide

> **Screen annotation made simple.** Draw, highlight, and present directly on your screen.

## What is Markury?

Markury is a screen annotation app that lets you draw, highlight, and annotate anything on your screen. Whether you're teaching, presenting, recording tutorials, or collaborating remotely — Markury gives you a floating toolbar with powerful drawing tools that work over any app or window.

Your drawings appear as an overlay, so you can annotate without disrupting what's underneath.

## Getting Started

When you launch Markury, a **floating toolbar** appears on your screen. This toolbar is your control center for all annotation features.

### First Steps

1. **Move the toolbar** — Click and drag the app icon (pen icon) to reposition the toolbar anywhere on screen.
2. **Start drawing** — Click the pencil icon to activate freehand drawing, then draw directly on your screen.
3. **Switch back** — Click the cursor icon to return to normal mode where you can click through to other apps.

### Quick Tips

- The toolbar stays on top of all other windows
- When you're not drawing, clicks pass through to the apps underneath
- Your toolbar position is remembered between sessions

---

## The Floating Toolbar

The toolbar is your main interface for all Markury features.

### Toolbar Basics

| Action | How to Do It |
|--------|--------------|
| **Move toolbar** | Drag the pen icon at the start of the toolbar |
| **Collapse/Expand** | Click the pen icon to toggle |
| **Find toolbar** | Use the system tray menu if you lose it |

### Toolbar Orientation

Switch between **vertical** and **horizontal** layouts to fit your workflow:

- **Vertical** — Takes up less horizontal space, great for side placement
- **Horizontal** — Compact height, ideal for top or bottom of screen

### Drawing Mode Indicator

When drawing mode is active, the toolbar shows a **cyan border glow** so you always know when your clicks will draw instead of passing through.

---

## Drawing Tools

### Cursor Tool
**Return to normal mode**

- Clicks pass through to underlying apps
- Use this when you're done annotating
- Drawings remain visible but you can interact with other windows

### Freehand Drawing
**Draw freely with your mouse or stylus**

- Click and drag to draw smooth strokes
- Strokes are automatically smoothed for a natural look
- Great for circling items, underlining text, or free-form sketching

### Highlighter
**Emphasize content with semi-transparent highlights**

- Works like a real highlighter marker
- Semi-transparent so text underneath remains readable
- Automatically uses a wider stroke for easy highlighting
- Perfect for marking important text or areas

### Eraser
**Remove unwanted strokes**

- Click and drag over any drawing to erase it
- Erases any stroke it touches
- Also removes text annotations
- Use to clean up mistakes or clear specific areas

---

## Colors & Stroke Width

### Choosing Colors

**Color Palette** — Click the color dots in the toolbar to open the color picker. Choose from 30+ colors organized in an easy-to-use grid.

**Quick Colors** — Four customizable color slots for your most-used colors. Access them instantly from the toolbar or with keyboard shortcuts (⌘1, ⌘2, ⌘3, ⌘4).

**Default Color** — Set your preferred starting color in Settings. Markury will use this color when you launch the app.

### Stroke Width

Adjust how thick your lines are:

- **Thin strokes** — Great for detailed annotations and writing
- **Medium strokes** — Good all-purpose thickness
- **Thick strokes** — Bold, highly visible marks

Click the stroke width button (shows "3 px" or similar) to see available options:
- 1 px — Fine detail
- 3 px — Standard drawing
- 5 px — Medium emphasis
- 10 px — Bold marks

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to quickly adjust thickness.

---

## Shape Tools

Create precise geometric shapes for professional-looking annotations.

### Line Tool
**Draw perfectly straight lines**

- Click where you want the line to start
- Drag to where you want it to end
- Release to place the line

Great for: Connecting items, pointing to specific areas, creating dividers

### Rectangle Tool
**Draw rectangular boxes**

- Click to set one corner
- Drag to the opposite corner
- Release to complete the rectangle

Great for: Highlighting areas, creating boxes around content, framing elements

### Circle Tool
**Draw perfect circles and ovals**

- Click to set the starting point

- Release to complete the shape

Great for: Circling important items, creating bullet points, emphasizing specific spots

### Arrow Tool
**Draw arrows that point to things**

- Click where you want the arrow to start
- Drag toward what you want to point at
- Release to place the arrow with its arrowhead

Great for: Directing attention, showing flow, indicating specific elements

---

## Text Annotations

Add typed text anywhere on your screen.

### How to Add Text

1. Select the **Text tool** from the toolbar
2. Click anywhere on screen where you want to add text
3. A text input box appears — type your message

### Text Features

## Laser Pointer

A virtual laser pointer for presentations — perfect for drawing attention without leaving permanent marks.

### How It Works

1. Select the **Laser Pointer** tool
2. Move your mouse to point at things
3. A bright trail follows your cursor
4. The trail **fades away automatically** after about 1.5 seconds

### When to Use It

- **Live presentations** — Point at items while talking
- **Screen recordings** — Guide viewers' attention
- **Teaching** — Highlight what you're explaining without cluttering the screen
- **Demonstrations** — Show where to click or look

The laser pointer leaves no permanent marks, so your screen stays clean.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Keep Your Toolbar Accessible
Position your toolbar where it won't block important content but is always within reach.

### Use Keyboard Shortcuts
Learn the shortcuts for your most-used tools to speed up your workflow.

### Customize Your Quick Colors
Set up your four quick colors for the tasks you do most often.

### Use the Right Tool for the Job
- **Freehand** for informal marks and circling
- **Shapes** for clean, professional annotations
- **Highlighter** for text emphasis
- **Laser pointer** for presentations

### Clear Regularly
Don't let annotations pile up — clear when you're done with a topic.

### Save Screenshots Strategically
Use clipboard mode for quick sharing, folder mode for documentation.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Toolbar Disappeared
Use the system tray menu → "Find Toolbar" to locate it with a visual pulse.

### Can't Draw on Screen
Make sure you've selected a drawing tool (not the cursor). Check that drawing mode is active (cyan border on toolbar).

### Screenshots Not Working
Markury needs Screen Recording permission. Go to System Preferences → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording and ensure Markury is enabled.

### Shortcuts Not Working
Markury needs Accessibility permission for global shortcuts. Go to System Preferences → Privacy & Security → Accessibility and ensure Markury is enabled.

### Drawings Not Visible
Click the visibility toggle to ensure drawings are shown, not hidden.

### License Activation Limit Reached
If activation fails with "This license key has reached the activation limit", your key is already in use on another device. Use the **Account** link shown in the License tab (or go to [app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders)) to manage your orders and deactivate an old activation, or upgrade your plan for more activations.
